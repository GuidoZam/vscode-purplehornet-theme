This is a theme for Visual Studio Code that I created for my own personal use. It is a dark theme with a purple background and orange text. I have named it Purple Hornet because I like the color purple and I like hornets. I hope you enjoy it!

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
